# Configuration

## Root configurations

* **clientKey** - A public key linked to your API credential, used for [client-side authentication](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/client-side-authentication).
* **amount** - Amount to be displayed on the Pay Button. It expects an object with the minor units value and currency properties. For example, `{ value: 1000, currency: 'USD' }` is **10$**. For card pre-authorisation set amount to `0` (zero).
* **countryCode** - The shopper's country code in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 format. Example: `"NL"` or `"US"`. 
* **shopperLocale** - üöß Work in progress. In current version this property only localises payment methods names. Default OS's locale is used for localisation.
* **returnUrl** - For iOS, this is the URL to your app, where the shopper should return, after a redirection. Maximum of 1024 characters. For more information on setting a custom URL scheme for your app, read the [Apple Developer documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/inter-process_communication/allowing_apps_and_websites_to_link_to_your_content/defining_a_custom_url_scheme_for_your_app).
For Android, this value is automatically overridden by `AdyenCheckout`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è To show the amount on the **Pay** button both *amount* and *countryCode* must be set.
